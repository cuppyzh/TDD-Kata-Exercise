Time Taken: 59m25s

**Summary**
Step 1--6 quite simple and easy, it was done under 20 minute, the issue occurred when more complex substring required during the remain step. 

On the middle of Step 7, I just realized that some of the requirement is missing, so need to fix something from Step 6.
Also, the code was changed from using Substring to Regex to simplify the code. 

**Room to Improve**
- Application of Substring sometimes confusing me
- Need to learn to be Native on Regex
